## Feature highlights

 * **Memory safety**. MesaLink is impervious to bugs like Heartbleed and buffer
   overflows becuse it is written in Rust.
 * **Cross Platform**. Linux, macOS, Android, Windows; x86, x86_64, armv7,
   aarch64... you name it. MesaLink probably compiles for it.
 * **Modern Ciphersuites**. MesaLink uses the best ciphersuites including
   AES-GCM, Chacha20Poly1305, and elliptic-curve key exchange with perfect
   forward secrecy.
 * **TLS 1.3**. Eight years since TLS 1.2, the faster and more secure TLS standard, is now in Rustls and MesaLink.
 * **Blazing Fast**. X25519 key exchange, AES-NI support, no language runtime
   like Java/Go. MesaLink runs at full speed on your metal.
 * **Flexible Configuration**: MesaLink offers flexible configurations tailored
   to your needs. You can customize which ciphers and TLS versions are built-in.
 * **Transparent Replacement**. MesaLink provides OpenSSL-compatible C APIs.
   Want to use MesaLink in curl or Android? No problem.
 * **Production Ready**. Baidu uses MesaLink in production with 10M monthly
   active users as of 12/2018

MesaLink depends on two Rust crates: [rustls](https://github.com/ctz/rustls) and
[sct](https://github.com/ctz/sct.rs). With them, MesaLink provides the following
features that are considered secure for most use cases:

* TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3
* ECDSA and RSA server authentication
* Forced hostname validation
* Forward secrecy using ECDHE; with curve25519, nistp256 or nistp384 curves.
* Safe and fast crypto primitives from BoringSSL
* AES-128-GCM, AES-256-GCM and Chacha20-Poly1305 bulk encryption
* Built-in Mozilla's CA root certificates

## Supported ciphersuites

* TLS13-CHACHA20-POLY1305-SHA256
* TLS13-AES-256-GCM-SHA384
* TLS13-AES-128-GCM_SHA256
* TLS-ECDHE-ECDSA-WITH-CHACHA20-POLY1305-SHA256
* TLS-ECDHE-RSA-WITH-CHACHA20-POLY1305-SHA256
* TLS-ECDHE-ECDSA-WITH-AES-256-GCM-SHA384
* TLS-ECDHE-ECDSA-WITH-AES-128-GCM-SHA256
* TLS-ECDHE-RSA-WITH-AES-256-GCM-SHA384
* TLS-ECDHE-RSA-WITH-AES-128-GCM-SHA256

## Building instructions for Autotools

```
$ sudo apt-get install m4 autoconf automake libtool make gcc curl
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

$ git clone https://github.com/mesalock-linux/tabbyssl.git
$ ./autogen.sh --enable-examples
$ make
```

## Building instructions for CMake

```
$ sudo apt-get install cmake make gcc curl
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

$ git clone https://github.com/mesalock-linux/tabbyssl.git
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .
```

## Examples
MesaLink comes with two examples that demonstrate a TLS client and a TLS
server. Both of them are located at `examples/`.

The client example connects to a remote HTTPS server and prints the server's
response.

```
$ ./examples/client/client api.ipify.org
[+] Negotiated ciphersuite: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, enc_length=16, version=TLS1.2
[+] Subject name: /OU=Domain Control Validated/OU=PositiveSSL Wildcard/CN=*.ipify.org

```

The server example comes with a pair of certificate and private key. The
certificate file is in the PEM format and contains a chain of certificates from
the server's certificate to the root CA certificate. The private key file
contains a PKCS8-encoded private key in the PEM format. Once the server is up
and running, open [https://127.0.0.1:8443](https://127.0.0.1:8443) and expect to
see the hello message.

```

## Unit tests
MesaLink uses cargo for unit tests. Simply run `cargo test`.

```
$ cargo test
```

## BoringSSL SSL tests
[BoGo](https://github.com/google/boringssl/tree/master/ssl/test) is BoringSSL's
protocol level test suite. We have ported BoGo for testing the functionality and
compatibility of MesaLink. To run BoGo test cases, run the following:

```
$ cd bogo && ./runme
```
