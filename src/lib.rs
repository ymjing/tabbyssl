//! # MesaLink: A safe, secure and OpenSSL-compatible TLS library
//!
//! Mesalink is a OpenSSL-compatible TLS library written in Rust, a programming
//! language that guaranteed memory safety and thread safety.
//!
//! ## Feature highlights
//!
//!  * **Memory safety**. MesaLink and its dependencies are written in
//!    [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), a programming language that guarantees
//!    memory safety. This extremely reduces attack surfaces of an TLS stack
//!    exposed in the wild, leaving the remaining attack surfaces auditable and
//!    restricted.
//!  * **Flexibility**. MesaLink offers flexible configurations tailored to
//!    various needs, for example IoT, connected home, automobiles, the cloud
//!    and more.
//!  * **Simplicity**. MesaLink does not support obselete or legacy TLS
//!    features, in case that misconfigurations introduce vulnerabilities.
//!  * **Compatibility**. MesaLink provides OpenSSL-compatible APIs. This makes
//!    it a breeze to port an existing OpenSSL project.
//!  * **Future proof**. MesaLink will support quantum-safe ciphersuites,
//!    safe-guarding TLS connections against even quantum computers.
//!
//! MesaLink depends on two Rust crates: [rustls](https://github.com/ctz/rustls)
//! and [sct](https://github.com/ctz/sct.rs). With them, MesaLink provides the
//! following features that are considered secure for most use cases:
//!
//! * TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 draft 23
//! * ECDSA or RSA server authentication
//! * Forced hostname validation
//! * Forward secrecy using ECDHE; with curve25519, nistp256 or nistp384 curves.
//! * Safe and fast crypto primitives from BoringSSL
//! * AES-128-GCM, AES-256-GCM and Chacha20-Poly1305 bulk encryption
//! * Built-in Mozilla's CA root certificates
//!
